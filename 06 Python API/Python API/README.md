Latitude and longitude values are traditionally measured either in decimal degrees or in degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS). **Latitude** values are measured relative to the **equator** and **range from -90째 at the South Pole to +90째 at the North Pole**. **Longitude** values are measured relative to the **prime meridian**. They **range from -180째 when traveling west to 180째 when traveling east**. If the prime meridian is at Greenwich, then Australia, which is south of the equator and east of Greenwich, has positive longitude values and negative latitude values.

* The bell curve shows the normal distribution of temprature in correlation with Latitude values. The weather is warmer near the **equator**.

* There is not much correlation between Latitude and Humidity. But in cities north to the **equator** have the dense clustor of humidity above 50%.

* There is not much correlation between Latitude and Cloudiness. But in cities north to the **equator** have the strong clustor of cloudiness above 80%.

## Instructions

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

### CHALLENGES

* Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

* Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
